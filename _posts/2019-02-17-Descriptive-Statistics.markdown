Statistics is a branch of mathematics that includes collection, organization, and interpretation of data. After collecting the data, it is the utmost priority to read and understand the data by using statistical technique before using an algorithm and making predictions.

Descriptive statistics and inferential statistic are two types of statistics. Descriptive statistics refers to the analysis of data that helps in organizing, showing and summarizing data in a clear and concise way, leading to some emerging pattern from the data. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, develops on the basis of probability theory and hypothesis. This blog focusses only on descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistic can be further divided into following:

1. Measures of central tendency
2. Measure of variability
3. Measure of relationship between variables

#### 1. Measures of central tendency
A measure of central tendency is a summary measure that represents a whole set of data with a unique value or a point that represents the center or middle of its distribution. There are three measures of central tendency:  mean, median and mode. Each of these examples describes the central value in the distribution.

##### Mean :
It is the average of all the numbers in a dataset. It is sum of all the numbers in a dataset divided by numbers of data in a dataset.

Where X in the value of each data and n is the total number of data

##### Example: Salary of 5 employees includes 7K, 6.6K, 7.5K, 8.9K, 7.5K. Mean salary is 7.5K

#### Advantage of the mean:  
1. The mean can be employed for both discrete and continuous numerical data.

#### Limitations of the mean:
1. The mean cannot be used for categorical data
2. The mean is highly influenced by outliers and skewed distributions.

#### Median:
It is a middle value in an ordered dataset.
Image position item when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.

#### Example: Salary of 5 employee includes 7K, 6.6K, 7.5K, 8.9K, 7.5K. To find the median, arrange the data in ascending order which is 6.6K, 7K, 7.5K, 7.5K, 8.9K. Median salary is (5+1)/2=3rd item in the list which is 7.5K. 

#### Advantage of median: 
1. The median is less influenced by outliers and skewed data compared to that of the mean due to which it is normally the chosen measure of central tendency when the distribution is asymmetrical. 

#### Limitation of the median:
1. The median cannot be used for categorical nominal data as it cannot be ordered.
