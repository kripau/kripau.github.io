I am Kripa Upreti,  Data science enthusiast.  I have used Neural Network  techniques in my civil engineering research work at NTU. I was fascinated by effectiveness of machine learning to find important attributes and their important scores. This motivated me to learn SQL, Tableau and more about data science.

In this blog, I will share the stuff which I believe will be helpful for the beginners to learn about Data Science.
